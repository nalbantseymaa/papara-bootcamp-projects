# Overview

In this project, independent entity management was provided by adding **Genre** and **Author** entities, and the relationships between these entities were structured. The **Genre** and **Book** entities, as well as the **Author** and **Book** objects, were associated with each other.

## Some of the Features

- When adding a book, the author information is also provided.
- Author information can be retrieved along with the related book objects.
- All books can be listed along with their author and genre information.
- Book information can be updated using the author ID and genre ID. This allows access to details such as which author wrote the books and which genre they belong to.
